# FSD-Elevation-Editor
This is the release repo for Foxtrot Scenery Design's Elevation Editor. This tool allows you to convert a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) raster image to Microsoft Flight Simulator Rectangle objects with heightmaps. 

## Roadmap
- [x] Create elevation rectangles from single georeferenced raster files
- [ ] Create elevation rectangles from multiple raster files
- [ ] Drape runways over customised terrain
- [ ] Add Irregular Tessellation for projects with various resolutions in different areas
- [ ] Improved UI and UX, especially visualising the area of interest being worked on and improved progress reporting
- [ ] Import/Export 3D models of (handsculped) terrain from and to MSFS

## Disclaimer
While this method works, it does not use the native CGL format since there is no updated method or tool available to generate CGL files. Therefore, this method is not guaranteed to offer the same performance as the native CGL files. Nonetheless, it should provide a reliable way to get elevation data into MSFS.
